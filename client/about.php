        Application USA is a comprehensive college application program that offers full support for students who wish to apply to universities in the US and UK. Utilizing the CommonAPP, Scoir, or UCAS platforms, the project provides guidance and resources for students throughout the application process. 

One of the key benefits of the program is the involvement of highly qualified mentors who are currently studying at top universities in the US, UK, Shanghai, and other countries. These individuals have first-hand knowledge of the college application process and are equipped to offer personalized advice and support to each student. They understand the unique challenges that students face and are committed to helping them overcome any obstacles and achieve their educational aspirations.
